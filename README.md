# SaltLakeCity-Pollution-Clusters

## Overview
This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that aims to determine the efficacy of different clustering algorithms (K-MEANS and HDBSCAN) for understanding air pollution patterns and sources within Salt Lake City. The project analyzes pollution and meteorilogical data from the EPA's Air Quality System API to identify patterns in the interactions between pollution and weather conditions from 2000 to 2021. Results were visualized and compared to existing source apportionment within the study to determine their effectiveness. Please see the included PDF for results, visualizations, and discussion, and the jupyter notebook for the code.
